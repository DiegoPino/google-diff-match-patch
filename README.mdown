# Diff, Match and Patch

This is the fork of [Diff, Match and Patch Library](http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/) by Neil Fraser.

The original library works with strings. My fork works with arrays:

    var dmp = new diff_match_patch()
    dmp.diff_main(['a', 'b'], ['b'])
    -> [
        [DIFF_DELETE, ['a']],
        [DIFF_EQUAL, ['b']]
    ]


## TODO
* make it work with both arrays and strings
* diff all objects
